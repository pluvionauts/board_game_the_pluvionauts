## Game setup

[//]: # (<img align="right" width="500" src="./images/setup.svg">)

1. The box of the game serves as the board. Start by removing the **balloon dice**, the 12 **villager request cards**, the 3 **lighthouse buildings**, the 3 **water tower buildings** and the 6 **wall buildings** from the box. 
The 5 **mountain tiles**, the 6 **forest tiles**, the 10 **plain tiles** and the 2 **weather dices** should remain in the box.
2. Now shuffle the box so that each hexagonal tile and the weather dices are placed randomly on the board. Then ensure that each hexagonal tile is correctly placed at the center of a board hexagon and place the box a the center of the table.
3. Each player receives 2 **villager request cards** and places them hidden in front of them. They can look at there own set of cards any time during the game. The remaining **villager request cards** are placed facedown near the board.
4. The first player, chosen at random, takes the **balloon dice**.

## Villagers quest

The aim of the game is to earn as much medals as possible by validating **villager requests**.
Two different type of **villager request** exists:
* **Weather requests**: villagers require a specific weather of a given terrain type (plain, forest, mountain).
* **Region requests**: villagers require a specific region size or a specific number of region of a given terrain type (plain, forest, mountain).

## Distance rules

The tile where the dice stands is considered at a distance 0 from the dice independently of the terrain.
The distance of adjacent tiles is however dependant of the terrain:
* An adjacent **empty tile** is at a distance of 1.
* An adjacent **plain tile** is also at a distance of 1.
* An adjacent **forest tile** is at a distance of 2.
* An adjacent **mountain tile** is at a distance of 3.

The distance of farther tiles from the dice is computed as the smallest distance required to reach that tile from the dice.

The same distance system is used to determine the weather range and the maximal balloon driving range.

## Playing the game

A game consists of several rounds that players take one after another in a clockwise direction.
In turn, the player performs the following actions in order:
1. **Balloon deployment:** throw the balloon dice on the board (refer to the **balloon deployment subtleties** section for more details). The position where the dice ended represents where your balloon ended pushed by the wind. The dice number represents the fuel remaining to continue piloting the balloon.
2. **Balloon driving:** move the balloon dice up to a distance of the number indicated on the **balloon dice** (the **distance rules** are presented below).
If the balloon dice ended on an island:
	3. **Island towing:** flip the balloon dice and move that island up to a distance of the new number indicated on the **balloon dice** (the **distance rules** are presented below).
**OPTIONALLY** the current player can:
	4. **Build:** place a building on an available spot adjacent to the balloon dice.
5. **Villager request validation:** they can **OPTIONALLY** validate **ONE** of their request cards. If so, they flip their card so that it is visible by all players and draw another request card.

## Changing the weather



## End of game

The end of the game is triggered when a player reaches **3** **villager request card**. 
Each **other** player then plays one last turn before the game ends.

Each player then counts all the medals accumulated on their validated **villager request cards**.
The balloonist with the most medals is elected the best **pluvionaut** of the country!
If there is a tie, the players share the victory.
